      <p>After the 2008 financial crisis, regulators devised a new framework, the Basel III regulations, which defines capital requirements for financial institutions. Banks could opt to apply for calculating the regulatory capital by their own internal models (IMM application). A successful IMM application can potentially, depending on the institution’s trading activity, save considerable regulatory capital. In order for an application to succeed, a firm has to prove, that the internal credit risk system is fit for purpose and that the reports produced by the system are effectively integrated as a part of the firm’s risk framework.
This involves providing quality guarantees for various areas. Having gone through several IMM applications in the role of  a head of Counterparty Credit Exposure Analytics, as well as a consultant, we can help you with the following</p>

<h1 id="models">Models</h1>

<p>The internal models used to calculate regulatory capital need to be fit for purpose. We can gain confidence, that the models, are appropriate by having</p>

<p>a structured model development process
an effective model approval process
internal audit reviews
We can help you in each of these area to find solutions, which are suitable for you particular institution.</p>

<h1 id="implementation">Implementation</h1>

<p>It must be made sure, that the models are appropriately implemented in the firm’s risk system. This involves</p>

<ul>
  <li>Specification</li>
  <li>Writing</li>
  <li>Testing</li>
  <li>Roll-out</li>
</ul>

<p>We can assist you to implement these steps in an efficient and appropriate way.</p>

<h1 id="policies-and-governance">Policies and Governance</h1>

<p>We can help you making sure, that the firm’s governance and policies are compliant with Basel III and FRTB requirements.</p>

<h1 id="imm-application">IMM Application</h1>

<p>An IMM application aims to present a high level narrative of the principles of the firm’s risk management framework, backed with evidence, that this framework is fit for purpose.
We can support you in the application process by sharing out first hand involvement in discussions with regulators and in composing such applications.</p>
