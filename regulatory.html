<h1>Regulatory Advice</h1>
</div>
<p>After the banking crisis of 2008 the regulatory requirements for banks grew significantly in terms of complexity and
implementation costs.</p>
<p>We can help you to fulfill these regulatory requirements in an cost efficient way by our extensive experience
with Basel III and FRTB programs in various major financial institutions.</p>

            <h3>The Client's Requirements</h3>
            The client, a global South African bank, planned to apply for IMM under Basel III. The IMM waiver
            required the institution to introduce a back-testing framework including principles,
            policies and procedures.
            <h3>Our Solution</h3>
              Based on our expericnce with an IMM application to the UK FSA, we helped the client to define a robust
              back-testing framework, which was practical and fulfilled the regulatory requirements.
            <h3>The Client's Benefits</h4>
              In addition to being able to meet the regulatory requirements, we provided to the firm a framework, which
              allows to quantify the quality of the model in <strong>economic</strong> terms. In addition to providing
              a pass/fail statement for the model performance, we were able to give to management a cash denominated estimate
              of the serverity of the model's shortcomings.

            Change does not roll in on the wheels of inevitability,
            but comes through continuous struggle.
            And so we must straighten our backs and work for
            our freedom. A man can't ride you unless your back is bent.

# Models

The internal models used to calculate regulatory capital need to be fit for purpose. We can gain confidence, that the models, are appropriate by having

- a structured model development process
- an effective model approval process
- and internal audit reviews

in place.
We can help you in each of these area to find solutions, which are suitable for you particular institution.

# Implementation

It must be made sure, that the models are appropriately implemented in the firm's risk system. This involves

- Specification
- Writing
- Testing
- Roll-out

We can assist you to implement these steps in an efficient and appropriate way.

# Policies and Governance

We can help you making sure, that the firm's governance and policies are compliant with Basel III and FRTB requirements.

# IMM Application

An IMM application aims to present a high level narrative of the principles of the firm's risk management framework, backed with evidence, that this framework is fit for purpose.
We can support you in the application process by sharing out first hand involvement in discussions with regulators and in composing such applications.
