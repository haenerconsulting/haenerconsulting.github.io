<h1>Regulatory Advice</h1>

            <h3>The Client's Requirements</h3>
            The client, a global South African bank, planned to apply for IMM under Basel III. The IMM waiver
            required the institution to introduce a back-testing framework including principles,
            policies and procedures.
            <h3>Our Solution</h3>
              Based on our expericnce with an IMM application to the UK FSA, we helped the client to define a robust
              back-testing framework, which was practical and fulfilled the regulatory requirements.
            <h3>The Client's Benefits</h3>
              In addition to being able to meet the regulatory requirements, we provided to the firm a framework, which
              allows to quantify the quality of the model in economic terms. In addition to providing
              a pass/fail statement for the model performance, we were able to give to management a cash denominated estimate
              of the serverity of the model's shortcomings.

            <h3>The Client's Requirements</h3>
                The Market Risk department of a major Scandinavian Bank decided to perform a feasibility study to assess the challenges for implementing
                the upcoming FRTB regulations.
            <h3>Our Solution</h3>
              We worked in partnership with a global management consulting firm to implement a FRTB compliant proptotype of a market risk framework. As
              leader of the workstream for data, we identified gaps in the data collectoion, transformation and storage processes as well as problems with
              data quality. Based on this we issued some recommendations, how to close this gap and achieve compliance. Furthermore we initiated first mitigating
              measures, which will be the base of a strategic solution.
            <h3>The Client's Benefits</h4>
              The client has an better understanding of data-related risks and now has a plan how to mitigate the existing shortcomings in order to get FRTB compliant.
