The unfolding of the banking crisis highlighted the importance of a robust risk management framework relying on meaningful risk measures. Financial institutions are now faced with the challenge to either implement Basel II and III compliant internal models or incur punitive capital requirements.

Building a risk system using internal models is particularly challenging, since all the required elements like compute infrastructure, data store, data integrity, model choice are subtly interdependent. The success of the project critically depends on having a deep understanding of how each particular decision concerning a building block affects the whole system. An integrated view of the system building process allows to produce under given budget and time constraints optimal solutions.
